# Matrix Client Files Ready for Installation

## Status: Files Copied and Ready

The following Matrix client files have been successfully copied to `/opt/stacks/claude-code-mcp/` and are ready to be moved to the `src/` directory:

✅ **matrix-client.ts** - Matrix bot service for sending job completion notifications
✅ **agent-room-mapping-client.ts** - Client for managing agent-to-room mappings
✅ **letta-callback-matrix.ts** - Matrix-enabled callback handler (will replace existing letta-callback.ts)

## Next Step: Run Installation Script

To complete the installation, run the following command as root or with sudo:

```bash
sudo /opt/stacks/claude-code-mcp/move_matrix_files.sh
```

## What the script does:

1. **Moves files to src/ directory**:
   - `matrix-client.ts` → `src/matrix-client.ts`
   - `agent-room-mapping-client.ts` → `src/agent-room-mapping-client.ts`
   - `letta-callback-matrix.ts` → `src/letta-callback.ts` (replaces existing)

2. **Sets proper permissions**:
   - Owner: `root:root`
   - Permissions: `644` (read/write for owner, read for group/others)

3. **Verifies installation** with file listing

## Files Overview:

- **matrix-client.ts**: Core Matrix bot service that handles:
  - Matrix client initialization and authentication
  - Room joining and message sending
  - Formatted job result notifications with HTML support
  - Proper error handling and logging

- **agent-room-mapping-client.ts**: Service for managing agent-to-room mappings:
  - CRUD operations for agent-room relationships
  - File-based persistence with JSON storage
  - Thread-safe operations with proper locking

- **letta-callback-matrix.ts**: Enhanced callback handler that:
  - Extends the original letta-callback.ts functionality
  - Adds Matrix notification support for async job completions
  - Integrates with the agent-room-mapping system
  - Maintains backward compatibility

## Ready to Install

All files are staged and ready. Just run the installation script with sudo privileges when ready.
